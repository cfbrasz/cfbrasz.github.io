	Click the mouse to create a ball at a point on the screen.<br>
	Drag the mouse before letting go to give it an initial velocity in that direction with a magnitude corresponding to how far you drag the mouse. <br>
	This is still pretty buggy and not fully functional, but it can have show some interesting and realistic effects of spin on how balls bounce.

		<b>Things to fix/finish in this simulation:</b><br>
		Activate the slider for the curvature of a ball's trajectory from spin (the slider does nothing right now). <br>
		Account for friction between ball and paddle.<br>
		Account for friction between balls.<br>
		Fix preset scenarios (they're mostly for debugging right now). <br>
		Change collision response so scenario like "Many balls" looks right (probably to velocity-level, impulse based approach).<br>
		Change collision response of balls with paddle as well (crazy stuff happens currently). <br>
		Account for rotation of paddle in paddle-ball collisions (right now just linear velocity taken into account). <br>
		Account for varying radii when handling collision response (right now all treated as equal mass objects). <br>
		Possibly add mouse control of paddle.<br>
		And eventually, if the physics look good, I may make a little 2D ping pong game with gravity and spin using two paddles. <br>
