<br>
Instructions:<br>
Click (and drag) on the screen to place robots (red dots).<br>
Click the Start rendezvous button to watch them converge to a single point. <br>
To see a quick example of what it does, choose a preset scenario and click start.<br>

Description: <br>
This applet simulates the robot rendezvous problem using three different schemes:<br>
1. A circumcenter algorithm, in which all robots simple move to the center of the smallest circumcircle<br>
containing all robots. (Least interesting to watch/simulate.)<br>
2. A curve-shortening scheme analogous to Euclidean curve-shortening but for discrete points, using the <br>
Menger-Melnikov curvature to evolve the polygon.
3. A linear curve-shortening scheme in which a robot moves toward the average position of its two neighbors.
<p>
Features:<br>
3 integrator types for the linear and Menger-Melnikov curvature schemes: forward Euler, implicit, and Runge-Kutta (4th order).<br>
The center of mass of the polygon is kept track of over time (one in terms of point masses, the other in terms of edges), as the Key describes.<br>
The area of the polygon is recorded each run in the window at the bottom. Try the preset scenario Area increase<br>
to see an example of a polygon of robots in which the area increases initially.<br>
Two other interesting preset scenarios are included, Spiral and Snake.
<p>
Random formations of robots can be generated using the Generate n random robots button.<br>
Availabe formations include:<br>
1. A star formation, in which the angle of the ray from the center of mass
to the robot increases with each subsequent robot in the polygon.<br>
2. A convex polygon.<br>
3. Completely random nonsimple polygon.<br>
You can also convert a given formation to a star ordering with the Convert to star ordering button.<br>
<p>
Checkboxes are available for recording the shape of the polygon every so often with a grey outline,<br>
tracing the paths of each individual robot, and merging robots that get very close to each other in the MM curvature scheme.<br>
(If you don't merge robots, this scheme starts to behave badly when robots get too close.)<br>
Merged robots turn cyan, and their paths turn pink.<br>
<p>
The mouse click action can be changed according to the radio buttons, and when dragging to create robots<br>
a slider changes how frequently robots are placed.<br>
The timestep size and number of steps run each time the screen is updated can also be changed with sliders,<br>
and their current values are also displayed.<br>
A timer keeps track of how much time passes in each run.<p>

The four buttons at the top control the action of the simulation. Resetting goes back to how the formation was at time zero,<br>
and removing all robots lets you start blank again.
<p>
This applet was made for a final project for the class Advanced Dynamics, MAE 542, at Princeton University.<br>
The paper on which most of these methods are described can be found at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.RO/0605070">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.RO/0605070</a>.<br>
