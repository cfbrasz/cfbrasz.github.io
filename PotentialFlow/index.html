This applet simulates potential flows, either by solving for the potential using boundary conditions and iteratively solving Laplace's equation <br>
(for vertical wall, diagonal wall, square, and diamond) or by the superposition of elementary potential flows<br>
into known configurations (for circle, half-plane, and rankine oval). <p>
In theory, potential flows about arbitrary shapes should be able to be simulated by imposing boundary conditions,<br>
but getting curved surfaces working is a bit tricky. <p>
Note that only the boundary condition flows use iterations, so changing the number won't affect the superpositions of elementary flows.
<br>
Also, equipotentials aren't functional yet, and the stream function is only shown for the superpositions of elementary flows.
