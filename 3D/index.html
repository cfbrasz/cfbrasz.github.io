Instructions: <p>
Move around and edit 3D environments with this applet. The controls on the interface can be used to:<br>
1) Change the viewer's position and direction<br>
2) Move the light source around<br>
3) Add and remove the following shapes: (rectangular prisms, cubes, spheres, circles, cylinders, and arbitrary polygons)<br>
(Note - When choosing coordinates for arbitrary polygons, once you have placed 3 points, you only need to specify<br>
two of the coordinates to add more vertices, since they have to lie on the existing plane. This won't work if the plane is parallel<br>
to the XY, XZ, or YZ planes.)<br>
4) Change settings that affect how the scene is portrayed, like the number of reflections a light ray can make, the resolution, and the lighting style. <p>
Also, the three arrows show the directions of the positive x, y, and z axes, and a drop box contains a few presets showing some possible things you can do with the program.
