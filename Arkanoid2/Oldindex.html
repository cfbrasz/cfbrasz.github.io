		Objective: Destroy all the blocks in each level without running out of lives. <br>
		There are a total of 10 stages. <br>
		You also get points for destroying blocks, getting powerups, and completing stages  
			so try and beat my high score of 106100. <br>
		Unfortunately, high scores aren't saved between sessions, but you can tell me your score 
			and I'll make that the high score.
		<p>
		Silver blocks take two hits to destroy. <br>
		Gold blocks can't be destroyed (unless you have the unstoppable ball powerup). <br>
		You can only have one powerup at a time. <br>
		You'll also probably notice that the ball eventually speeds up, and this happens because of a
		slight increase in speed every time the ball bounces off something.

		This was my final project for an introductory computer science class, CSCI 134, taken at Williams College in the fall of 2008.<br>
		Based off of the original Arkanoid game, which you can see at
